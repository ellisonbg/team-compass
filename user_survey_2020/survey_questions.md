## Data

This section originally contained 3 questions about the data format, sources, and data pain points. It isn't clear how these questions would lead to actionable insight for JupyterLab, so we were talking about removing this section. See the above Google Doc for the original questions.

## Visualization

This section originally contained 4 questions about data visualization. It isn't clear how these questions would lead to actionable insight for JupyterLab, so we were talking about removing this section. See the above Google Doc for the original questions.

## Machine learning

This section originally contained 5 questions about machine learning. It isn't clear how these questions would lead to actionable insight for JupyterLab, so we were talking about removing this section. See the above Google Doc for the original questions.

## Workload

This section originally contained 2 questions about workload. See the above Google Doc for the original questions.
